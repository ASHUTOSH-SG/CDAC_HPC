### **Session 1: Disk Storage Systems**

**1. Types of Storage**
- **Primary Storage (Volatile Memory)**: Refers to the storage devices that provide fast access to data but lose the data when power is turned off. Examples: RAM, cache memory.
- **Secondary Storage (Non-Volatile Memory)**: Provides persistent data storage that retains data even after power loss. Examples: Hard Disk Drives (HDD), Solid-State Drives (SSD), and optical disks.
- **Tertiary Storage**: Used for long-term storage or backup. Data is typically archived and accessed infrequently. Examples: Tape drives, cloud storage.
- **Cloud Storage**: Storage services offered via the internet, allowing for data storage and access remotely. Examples: Google Drive, AWS S3.

**2. Storage Protocols**
- **SCSI (Small Computer System Interface)**: A set of standards for connecting and transferring data between computers and peripheral devices. Used for hard drives, scanners, and printers.
- **SATA (Serial Advanced Technology Attachment)**: A protocol used for connecting hard drives and SSDs to motherboards or host controllers.
- **SAS (Serial Attached SCSI)**: An improved version of SCSI for high-speed data transfer between storage devices.
- **Fibre Channel (FC)**: A high-speed network technology used for connecting storage devices in a SAN (Storage Area Network).
- **iSCSI (Internet Small Computer Systems Interface)**: Allows the SCSI protocol to be used over TCP/IP networks, often in a storage area network (SAN).

RAID is a technology that combines multiple disk drives into a single unit to improve performance, availability, and data redundancy. Here are some common RAID levels:

- **RAID 0 (Striping)**: 
  - **Performance**: High, since data is split across multiple disks, allowing simultaneous reads and writes.
  - **Availability**: Low, as there is no redundancy. If one disk fails, all data is lost.

- **RAID 1 (Mirroring)**:
  - **Performance**: Good read performance but write performance is similar to a single drive due to mirroring.
  - **Availability**: High, as data is mirrored across two disks. If one disk fails, data is still available on the other disk.

- **RAID 5 (Striping with Parity)**:
  - **Performance**: Balanced, with good read performance. Write performance can be slower due to parity calculations.
  - **Availability**: High, as data is striped across multiple disks with parity information distributed. If one disk fails, data can be rebuilt from parity.

- **RAID 6 (Double Parity)**:
  - **Performance**: Similar to RAID 5 but slower due to double parity.
  - **Availability**: Very high, as two disks can fail without data loss due to double parity.

- **RAID 10 (1+0) (Mirroring + Striping)**:
