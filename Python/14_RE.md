# Regular Expressions in Python

## Overview
Regular expressions (regex) are sequences of characters that define a search pattern, primarily used for matching, searching, and manipulating strings.

## Library
- **`re`**: Python's built-in library for working with regular expressions.

## Key Functions

1. **`re.search(pattern, string)`**
   - Searches for the first occurrence of the specified pattern in the string.
   - Returns a match object if found; otherwise, returns `None`.
   - **Example**:
     ```python
     import re
     result = re.search(r'\d+', 'The year is 2024')
     ```

2. **`re.match(pattern, string)`**
   - Checks for a match only at the beginning of the string.
   - Returns a match object if found; otherwise, returns `None`.
   - **Example**:
     ```python
     result = re.match(r'The', 'The year is 2024')
     ```

3. **`re.findall(pattern, string)`**
   - Finds all non-overlapping matches of the pattern in the string.
   - Returns a list of all matches.
   - **Example**:
     ```python
     matches = re.findall(r'\d+', 'There are 2 apples and 3 oranges')
     ```

4. **`re.sub(pattern, repl, string)`**
   - Substitutes matches of the pattern with a specified string (`repl`).
   - Returns the modified string.
   - **Example**:
     ```python
     modified_string = re.sub(r'apples', 'bananas', 'I like apples')
     ```

5. **`re.split(pattern, string)`**
   - Splits the string by the occurrences of the pattern.
   - Returns a list of substrings.
   - **Example**:
     ```python
     parts = re.split(r'\s+', 'Split this string by spaces')
     ```

## Conclusion
Regular expressions are a powerful tool for string manipulation and pattern matching in Python. The `re` library provides various functions to search, match, and modify strings using regex patterns.


## metacharacters used in regular expressions:

| Metacharacter | Description                                 | Example                             |
|---------------|---------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| `.`           | Matches any single character except newline | `a.c` matches "abc", "a1c", etc.   |
| `^`          | Matches the start of the string            | `^Hello` matches "Hello, world"    |
| `$`          | Matches the end of the string              | `world$` matches "Hello, world"    |
| `*`          | Matches 0 or more repetitions of the preceding element | `a*` matches "", "a", "aa", etc. |
| `+`          | Matches 1 or more repetitions of the preceding element | `a+` matches "a", "aa", etc.     |
| `?`          | Matches 0 or 1 repetition of the preceding element | `a?` matches "", "a"             |
| `{n}`        | Matches exactly n repetitions of the preceding element | `a{2}` matches "aa"              |
| `{n,}`       | Matches n or more repetitions of the preceding element | `a{2,}` matches "aa", "aaa", etc. |
| `{n,m}`      | Matches between n and m repetitions        | `a{1,3}` matches "a", "aa", "aaa" |
| `[...]`      | Matches any single character within the brackets | `[abc]` matches "a", "b", or "c" |
| `[^...]`     | Matches any single character not in the brackets | `[^abc]` matches any character except "a", "b", or "c" |
| `|`          | Acts as a logical OR between expressions    | `a|b` matches "a" or "b"           |
| `(...)`      | Groups expressions and captures matches     | `(abc)` captures "abc"              |
| `\`          | Escapes a metacharacter to treat it as a literal | `\.` matches the dot character "." |


## Basic Syntax â€“ Anchors and boundaries

| `$`               | Matches the end of a string                      | `world$` matches "Hello world"     |
| `\b`              | Matches a word boundary                          | `\bword\b` matches "word" in "word play" but not in "sword" |
| `\B`              | Matches a non-word boundary                      | `\Bword\B` matches "word" in "swordplay" but not in "word" |
| `(?=...)`         | Positive lookahead: asserts that what follows matches the pattern | `\d(?= dollars)` matches "5" in "5 dollars" |
| `(?!...)`         | Negative lookahead: asserts that what follows does not match the pattern | `\d(?! dollars)` matches "5" in "5 apples" but not in "5 dollars" |
