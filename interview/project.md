### Summary of AWS VPC and Networking Setup for HPC-Stack Project

**1. AWS VPC Creation:**
A Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) named **SLURM-VPC** with CIDR Block **10.0.0.0/16** is created to ensure a secure and isolated network environment. This allows users to define IP ranges, subnets, and security configurations, isolating resources from others.

**2. Configuring Subnets:**
- **Private Subnet (For Controller):**
  - Name: **PrivateSubnet**
  - CIDR: **10.0.1.0/24**
  - Public IP: Disabled (ensures isolation and security)
  
- **Public Subnet (For Bastion Host):**
  - Name: **PublicSubnet**
  - CIDR: **10.0.2.0/24**
  - Public IP: Enabled (allows public access for secure gateway purposes)

**3. Attaching an Internet Gateway (IGW):**
An **Internet Gateway (SLURM-IGW)** is attached to the VPC to enable internet communication for public-facing instances.

**4. Route Table Configuration:**
- **Public Route Table:**
  - Name: **Public-RT**
  - Routes: `0.0.0.0/0 -> SLURM-IGW` (Ensures instances in the public subnet can access the internet)
  
- **Private Route Table:**
  - A **NAT Gateway (SLURM-NAT)** in the public subnet allows controlled internet access for private instances (enabling updates and resource access).
  - Uses an **Elastic IP** for static, stable, and failover-supported outbound communication.

**5. AWS Instance Launching:**
- **Controller Node (Private Subnet):**
  - Instance Type: **t3.medium or t3.large**
  - Security: SSH only from Bastion Host, SLURM Ports (6817-6819) open
  - Storage: **20GB SSD**
  
- **Bastion Host (Public Subnet):**
  - Instance Type: **t2.micro**
  - Security: SSH access limited to trusted IP ranges
  - Storage: **8GB SSD**

**6. Instance Connectivity:**
- **Accessing Bastion Host:** Direct SSH access is not allowed to private instances, and users must access the Bastion Host first using SSH.
- **Accessing Controller via Bastion:** The controller node can be accessed only through the Bastion Host for enhanced security.

### Summary of Reverse SSH and SSH Key Generation

#### 1. **Generating SSH Keys on Local Machine**
SSH keys are used for secure, password-less authentication between systems. Here's how you can generate SSH keys on your local machine:

- **Steps to Generate SSH Keys**:
  1. Open a terminal on your local machine.
  2. Run the following command to generate an RSA SSH key pair with 4096 bits:
     ```bash
     ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096
     ```
  3. When prompted, press Enter to accept the default file location (`~/.ssh/id_rsa`).
  4. Optionally, set a passphrase for additional security (this is recommended).
  5. After successful key generation, two files are created:
     - `id_rsa`: The private key (keep this secure and never share it).
     - `id_rsa.pub`: The public key (this can be shared and added to remote systems for authentication).

- **Viewing Your Public Key**:
  To view your public key, use the following command:
  ```bash
  cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
  ```

#### 2. **Reverse SSH Port Forwarding**
Reverse SSH port forwarding allows remote systems to access services running on your local machine by creating an SSH tunnel. This is useful for accessing internal services from a remote server.

- **Steps to Establish Reverse SSH Tunneling**:
  To create a reverse SSH tunnel and expose local ports to the remote machine, use the following command:
  ```bash
  ssh -R 22:localhost:22 -R 6818:localhost:6818 -R 7003:localhost:7003 ubuntu@13.233.71.90
  ```
  This command does the following:
  - **Port 22**: Allows SSH access to the local machine from the remote system (localhost:22 → remote:22).
  - **Port 6818**: Exposes port 6818 for SLURM communication (localhost:6818 → remote:6818).
  - **Port 7003**: Exposes port 7003 for other services (localhost:7003 → remote:7003).

- **Stabilizing the Connection**:
  To ensure the connection remains stable, you can add these SSH options:
  ```bash
  ssh -R 22:localhost:22 -R 6818:localhost:6818 -R 7003:localhost:7003 -o ServerAliveInterval=60 -o ServerAliveCountMax=3 ubuntu@13.233.71.90
  ```
  - `ServerAliveInterval=60`: Sends a keep-alive signal every 60 seconds to keep the session active.
  - `ServerAliveCountMax=3`: Allows the session to survive for 3 missed keep-alive signals before disconnecting.

**Note**: Ensure that the necessary ports (22, 6818, 7003) are open in the security groups and firewall settings on both the local and remote systems.

### Alternate Approach & Advantages

#### Alternate Approach:
1. **Using VPN for Secure Access**:
   An alternative to reverse SSH is setting up a Virtual Private Network (VPN) between the local and remote systems. This allows you to create a secure, encrypted tunnel for accessing remote resources.

   **Advantages**:
   - VPNs provide broader network access beyond individual ports.
   - VPNs may offer better reliability for large-scale systems with multiple ports or services.
   - More scalable when managing access for multiple users or systems.

#### Advantages of Reverse SSH:
- **Simplicity**: Reverse SSH is simple to set up, requiring only SSH and no additional configurations like VPNs or firewalls.
- **Portability**: Can be used on machines where configuring a VPN is not feasible.
- **Security**: SSH uses strong encryption, ensuring secure communication between systems without exposing services directly on the internet.

### Interview Questions

**1. What is SSH key-based authentication, and why is it preferred over password-based authentication?**
- *Answer*: SSH key-based authentication is a more secure method where an SSH key pair (private and public keys) is used for authentication instead of passwords. It's preferred because it avoids the risks of brute-force password attacks, and it's more secure, especially when using passphrases for the private key.

**2. What are the advantages of using SSH keys over traditional passwords?**
- *Answer*: SSH keys are much more secure as they are based on cryptographic algorithms that are much harder to crack than passwords. Additionally, SSH keys avoid the need to remember passwords and provide better security against man-in-the-middle attacks.

**3. How do you generate SSH keys on a local machine?**
- *Answer*: You can generate SSH keys by using the command `ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096`. This will create a private key (`id_rsa`) and a public key (`id_rsa.pub`), which can be used for secure communication.

**4. What is reverse SSH, and why would you use it?**
- *Answer*: Reverse SSH is a method where an SSH tunnel is created from the remote system to the local system, allowing services on the local machine to be accessed by the remote machine. It's useful for accessing internal services behind firewalls or NATs without directly exposing them.

**5. What is the purpose of the `-R` option in reverse SSH port forwarding?**
- *Answer*: The `-R` option specifies reverse port forwarding, which makes a port on the remote machine accessible to the local machine. For example, `-R 22:localhost:22` allows SSH access to the local system from the remote machine.

**6. How does reverse SSH port forwarding differ from traditional port forwarding?**
- *Answer*: Traditional port forwarding exposes a port on the local machine to remote users. In contrast, reverse SSH port forwarding allows remote systems to access local services by forwarding a remote port to a local machine's port.

**7. What are the potential risks of reverse SSH?**
- *Answer*: Reverse SSH can pose security risks if not properly configured. Exposing sensitive services to the internet via reverse SSH can lead to unauthorized access if proper authentication and encryption are not used.

**8. How would you ensure the stability of the reverse SSH tunnel connection?**
- *Answer*: To ensure stability, you can use options like `ServerAliveInterval` and `ServerAliveCountMax` in your SSH configuration. These options send periodic keep-alive signals to prevent the connection from timing out.

**9. How do you verify that the reverse SSH tunnel is working as expected?**
- *Answer*: You can verify the reverse SSH tunnel by trying to access the forwarded services (like SSH or SLURM) from the remote system. If successful, the connection is working as expected.

**10. What is the difference between a VPN and reverse SSH?**
- *Answer*: A VPN creates a secure tunnel for accessing a network, allowing access to multiple services across the network. Reverse SSH, on the other hand, only forwards specific ports from a remote system to a local machine, making it more lightweight but with limited use cases.

**11. Why would you use reverse SSH over a VPN in some scenarios?**
- *Answer*: Reverse SSH is simpler to set up, requires fewer resources, and is ideal for accessing specific services on a machine without the need for full network access, as would be the case with a VPN.

**12. How would you secure a reverse SSH tunnel?**
- *Answer*: To secure the reverse SSH tunnel, ensure that SSH key-based authentication is used, and that strong passphrases are set for private keys. Also, limit access by IP and use firewall rules to restrict unwanted traffic.

**13. How do you manage port forwarding in a reverse SSH scenario with multiple services?**
- *Answer*: You can forward multiple ports in one command, as shown in the example (`-R 22:localhost:22 -R 6818:localhost:6818 -R 7003:localhost:7003`). Each port forwards a specific service from the local machine to the remote system.

**14. What does the `ServerAliveInterval` and `ServerAliveCountMax` options do in the SSH command?**
- *Answer*: `ServerAliveInterval` sets the time interval (in seconds) for sending keep-alive signals. `ServerAliveCountMax` defines how many times the keep-alive signal can fail before disconnecting the session. These options help maintain the SSH session in long-running environments.

**15. How can reverse SSH help in accessing services behind a firewall or NAT?**
- *Answer*: Reverse SSH allows remote systems to connect to local services without the need for opening ports on the firewall or NAT. This is useful for secure remote access to internal systems without exposing them directly to the public internet.

**16. What would happen if the ports used for reverse SSH are blocked by a firewall?**
- *Answer*: If the ports are blocked, the reverse SSH tunnel will not be established, and the remote system will not be able to access the local services. You would need to ensure that the necessary ports are open in both firewalls.

**17. How would you troubleshoot a reverse SSH connection that is not working?**
- *Answer*: I would first check if the SSH keys are correctly configured, ensure the necessary ports are open, and verify that the remote system can reach the local machine. I would also check the SSH logs for any error messages.

**18. What security precautions should be taken when using reverse SSH?**
- *Answer*: Use SSH key-based authentication, configure firewalls to restrict access, and use strong passphrases for private keys. Additionally, ensure that SSH servers are properly configured to only allow trusted users and hosts.

**19. Can reverse SSH be used to access GPU resources on the local machine?**
- *Answer*: Yes, reverse SSH can be used to forward GPU access by allowing the remote system to connect to services that use the GPU on the local machine. However, additional configuration would be needed for GPU sharing.

**20. How would you configure multiple reverse SSH tunnels for different services (like SLURM, SSH, and HTTP)?**
- *Answer*: You can create multiple `-R` options in the same SSH command to forward different ports for each service. For example:
  ```bash
  ssh -R 22:localhost:22 -R 6818:localhost:6818 -R 7003:localhost:7003 ubuntu@remote_ip
  ```
This forwards SSH, SLURM, and HTTP services through the reverse SSH tunnel.

     # Simulate some work
     for i in range(10):
         st.write(f'Processing step {i+1}')
         time.sleep(1)
     
     st.success('Job completed successfully!')
     ```

3. **Create SLURM Job Script:**
   - Create a submission script (e.g., `run_streamlit.sh`) to run the Streamlit app on SLURM:
     ```bash
     #!/bin/bash
     #SBATCH --job-name=streamlit_app
     #SBATCH --output=streamlit_%j.out
     #SBATCH --error=streamlit_%j.err
     #SBATCH --nodes=1
     #SBATCH --ntasks=1

     # Load Python environment if needed
     streamlit run app.py --server.port 8501
     ```

4. **Submit and Monitor the Job:**
   - Submit the SLURM job:
     ```bash
     sbatch run_streamlit.sh
     ```
   - To check the job status, use:
     ```bash
     squeue
     ```
   - To view the job’s output logs:
     ```bash
     cat streamlit_*.out
     ```

   - To access the Streamlit application from a local machine, use SSH port forwarding:
     ```bash
     ssh -L 8501:localhost:8501 username@controller
     ```
   - Open your browser and go to:
     ```bash
     http://localhost:8501
     ```
   - Ensure your firewall allows the connection and adjust port numbers and hostnames as necessary.

6. **Example Python Job with Output:**
   - Create a simple Python script (`example.py`) for data analysis:
     ```python
     import numpy as np
     import pandas as pd

     # Create sample data
     data = np.random.randn(1000, 4)
     df = pd.DataFrame(data, columns=['A', 'B', 'C', 'D'])

     # Perform calculations
     result = df.describe()
     print("Data Analysis Results:")
     print(result)
     ```
   - Then, create the SLURM submission script (`submit_python.sh`) for the Python job:
     ```bash
     #!/bin/bash
     #SBATCH --job-name=python_analysis
     #SBATCH --output=analysis_%j.out

### Alternate Approach & Advantages

**Alternate Approach: Using a Managed Monitoring Service (e.g., AWS CloudWatch, Datadog)**
- Instead of setting up Prometheus and Grafana manually, you could use managed solutions like **AWS CloudWatch** or **Datadog** for monitoring.
  - **AWS CloudWatch**: Easily integrates with EC2 instances, provides automatic dashboards, and simplifies the setup for monitoring metrics (CPU, memory, disk, etc.) and custom metrics (like GPU utilization) via CloudWatch agents.
  - **Datadog**: Provides advanced monitoring, including seamless integration with containerized environments (Kubernetes), as well as built-in support for GPU metrics.

**Advantages of the Managed Approach**:
- **Simplified Setup**: These services provide pre-configured solutions, reducing manual installation and configuration time.
- **Scalability**: Easily scales with your infrastructure without additional setup.
- **Advanced Features**: Includes alerting, anomaly detection, and automatic scaling that may not be available in a self-managed Prometheus-Grafana setup.
- **No Maintenance**: Managed services handle upgrades, patches, and ongoing maintenance.

**Why Prometheus & Grafana is Beneficial in This Project**:
- **Customizable Dashboards**: Prometheus and Grafana provide high levels of customization for monitoring specific metrics such as GPU usage and EC2 node performance, tailored to your HPC stack.
- **Self-hosted**: Unlike managed services, this approach keeps all data within your own infrastructure, providing more control over data privacy and usage.
- **Open-source**: Being open-source tools, they offer flexibility, cost-effectiveness, and a large community for support.

### 20 Interview Questions with Scenario-based Answers

1. **What is Prometheus, and why did you choose it for monitoring your cluster?**
   - **Answer**: Prometheus is an open-source monitoring and alerting toolkit widely used for monitoring applications, services, and clusters. It’s highly suited for cloud-native environments, supports custom metrics, and integrates seamlessly with Grafana for visualization.

2. **Can you describe a situation where you had to debug an issue with Prometheus?**
   - **Scenario**: Imagine that Prometheus isn't scraping data from one of your EC2 instances. How would you troubleshoot?
   - **Answer**: First, I'd check the `prometheus.yml` configuration to ensure the target IP and port are correct. Then, I'd verify if the Node Exporter is running on the target machine and check firewall settings. I would also look at Prometheus logs for errors.

3. **What is the role of Node Exporter in this setup?**
   - **Answer**: Node Exporter collects system-level metrics (e.g., CPU, memory, disk usage) from the nodes (EC2 instances or containers) and exposes them for Prometheus to scrape.

4. **How would you handle scaling Prometheus if the number of monitored instances increases significantly?**
   - **Answer**: I would consider using Prometheus federation, where a central Prometheus server aggregates data from multiple Prometheus instances that are scraping smaller sets of targets. I could also scale horizontally by adding more Prometheus servers.

5. **What is the significance of the `scrape_interval` setting in Prometheus configuration?**
   - **Answer**: The `scrape_interval` determines how often Prometheus scrapes metrics from its targets. Short intervals lead to more frequent data collection but can increase load, while longer intervals reduce the load but may result in less granular data.

6. **Why did you choose Grafana for visualization over other tools?**
   - **Answer**: Grafana provides powerful and flexible visualization options, integrates well with Prometheus, and supports complex dashboards and alerting. It’s widely used in the industry and has an active community for support.

7. **What could be the potential bottlenecks in an HPC cluster when monitoring with Prometheus and Grafana?**
   - **Answer**: Bottlenecks could arise from large-scale metrics collection, especially if too many targets are scraped too frequently, or if the storage backend for Prometheus isn’t optimized. Grafana dashboards with complex queries could also strain the server if not properly managed.

8. **Explain how you would monitor GPU metrics in this setup.**
   - **Answer**: I would install the NVIDIA DCGM Exporter on the GPU-enabled containers to expose GPU-specific metrics, such as GPU utilization and memory usage. These metrics are then scraped by Prometheus and visualized in Grafana.

9. **How does Prometheus handle high-availability configurations?**
   - **Answer**: Prometheus supports high-availability setups through replication. Multiple Prometheus servers can be configured to scrape the same targets, ensuring data redundancy. In case one server fails, the others continue to collect data.

10. **Can you explain the process of integrating Prometheus with Kubernetes for monitoring?**
    - **Answer**: In Kubernetes, Prometheus can be deployed using Helm charts, where it collects metrics from nodes and pods. Kubernetes provides automatic service discovery, so Prometheus can dynamically discover and scrape metrics from containerized applications.

11. **How would you troubleshoot an issue with Grafana dashboards not updating in real-time?**
    - **Answer**: First, I would verify if Grafana is properly connected to the Prometheus data source. Next, I would check if Prometheus is collecting metrics at the expected intervals and ensure there are no issues with the query performance in Grafana.

12. **What is the role of the Prometheus `alertmanager`?**
    - **Answer**: Alertmanager handles the alerts generated by Prometheus when specific thresholds are met (e.g., high CPU usage or low memory). It can send notifications through email, Slack, or other communication tools.

13. **Describe a situation where you would need to adjust the retention period in Prometheus.**
    - **Scenario**: Suppose you have a limited storage capacity on Prometheus and want to retain only the most recent data.
    - **Answer**: I would adjust the `--storage.tsdb.retention.time` flag to specify a shorter retention period (e.g., 30 days). This would ensure older data is purged automatically to free up space.

14. **How would you monitor network traffic using Prometheus and Grafana?**
    - **Answer**: I would use the `node_exporter` to collect network-related metrics such as bytes received and transmitted. In Grafana, I would create a dashboard to visualize the network throughput and other relevant metrics.

15. **Explain the concept of Prometheus "scraping" in detail.**
    - **Answer**: Scraping is the process by which Prometheus collects metrics from configured targets at regular intervals. Each target exposes metrics at an HTTP endpoint, and Prometheus pulls this data using HTTP requests.

16. **How do you ensure security when exposing Prometheus and Grafana dashboards publicly?**
    - **Answer**: To secure Prometheus and Grafana, I would implement access control using authentication and authorization mechanisms, restrict IP access, and use TLS encryption for data transmission. Additionally, I could set up a VPN or reverse proxy for secure access.

17. **What steps would you take if Prometheus is consuming too much disk space?**
    - **Answer**: I would reduce the data retention time, optimize the scrape interval, or use remote storage solutions to offload older data. I might also adjust the `max_samples` limit or query intervals to prevent excessive data storage.

18. **What would be your approach if the GPU metrics displayed in Grafana are inconsistent?**
    - **Answer**: I would first check if the NVIDIA DCGM Exporter is running correctly and scraping the metrics. Next, I would verify if Prometheus is correctly collecting the data and if there are any query issues in Grafana.

19. **How do you manage permissions and access for different teams using Grafana?**
    - **Answer**: Grafana supports user roles and permissions. I would create teams with appropriate access levels (Admin, Editor, Viewer) and assign dashboards accordingly to ensure proper access control.

20. **If you were to extend this system, how would you add more instances or containers for monitoring?**
    - **Answer**: I would update the `prometheus.yml` configuration to add new targets (instances or containers) and adjust the scrape interval if needed. Grafana dashboards would be updated to include the new metrics as necessary.



    ### Reverse SSH Flow from Private Subnet AWS Controller to On-Prem Compute Node via Bastion Host

#### **Overview of the Setup:**
- **Bastion Host (Public Subnet)**: An EC2 instance with public access that allows communication between the private subnet and external systems (like on-prem compute nodes).
- **Controller (Private Subnet)**: An EC2 instance located in the private subnet with no direct public access.
- **On-Prem Compute Node**: A system located on the local network, which needs to connect to the AWS private subnet (Controller).

#### **Alternatives to Reverse SSH:**
1. **VPN (Virtual Private Network)**:
   - **Method**: Establish a VPN between AWS VPC (Private Subnet) and the On-Prem Compute Node using either IPsec, OpenVPN, or WireGuard.
   - **Disadvantages**: Complex setup, higher cost, latency, requires static IP on-prem.
   
2. **VPC Peering**:
   - **Method**: Use VPC peering to connect AWS VPC with another VPC on-prem.
   - **Disadvantages**: Only works with AWS-hosted VPC, no transitive routing.

3. **AWS Direct Connect**:
   - **Method**: Establish a dedicated physical connection between AWS and on-prem infrastructure.
   - **Disadvantages**: Expensive, long setup time, not suitable for dynamic connections.

4. **AWS Systems Manager (SSM)**:
   - **Method**: Use SSM Agent on the controller and execute commands via SSM from the On-Prem Compute Node.
   - **Disadvantages**: Limited to command execution, lacks persistent SSH shell, requires proper IAM configuration.

5. **NAT Gateway**:
   - **Method**: Use a NAT Gateway to enable outbound traffic from the AWS Private Subnet to the On-Prem Compute Node.
   - **Disadvantages**: Expensive, only outbound, no bidirectional communication.

#### **Why Reverse SSH is the Best Option:**
- Simple, without complex networking setup.
- Cost-effective (no need for VPN, VPC Peering, or Direct Connect).
- Secures the controller by keeping it inside a private subnet while still allowing outbound SSH access.
- Bypasses the challenges of dynamic IP addresses for the on-prem node.
- Automatable with tools like `autossh` or `systemd`.

### **Step-by-Step Reverse SSH Configuration:**

#### **1. Open Required Ports:**
- **On-Prem Compute Node**: Open port 22 (SSH) to accept incoming SSH connections from AWS.
- **Bastion Host (Public Subnet)**: Allow inbound port 22 from both the Controller (AWS Private Subnet) and the On-Prem Compute Node. Allow outbound port 22 to the On-Prem Compute Node.
- **Controller (Private Subnet)**: Allow outbound SSH (port 22) to the Bastion Host.

#### **2. Configure Reverse SSH on the Controller:**
Run this command on the **Controller** (AWS Private Subnet) to create a reverse SSH tunnel to the On-Prem Compute Node via the Bastion Host:

```bash
ssh -N -R 2222:localhost:22 user@bastion-public-ip
```

- `-N`: Does not open a shell, only sets up the tunnel.
- `-R 2222:localhost:22`: Forwards port 2222 on the Bastion Host to port 22 on the Controller.
- `user@bastion-public-ip`: SSH into the Bastion Host.

#### **3. Access Controller from On-Prem Compute Node:**
Once the reverse SSH tunnel is established, SSH into the **Controller** from the **On-Prem Compute Node** via the Bastion Host:

```bash
ssh -J user@bastion-public-ip -p 2222 user@localhost
```

- `-J user@bastion-public-ip`: Specifies the Bastion Host as a jump host.
- `-p 2222`: Connects to the reverse SSH tunnel.
- `user@localhost`: Connects to the Controller via the tunnel.

Now the On-Prem Compute Node can SSH into the Controller in the AWS Private Subnet via the Bastion Host.

### **Interview Questions with Answers:**

1. **What is Reverse SSH?**
   - Reverse SSH allows an instance in a private subnet to establish an SSH connection to a remote system by opening a reverse SSH tunnel, enabling external access to the private network.

2. **What is a Bastion Host in AWS?**
   - A Bastion Host is an EC2 instance in a public subnet that serves as a secure entry point for managing instances in a private subnet via SSH or RDP.

3. **Why would you use Reverse SSH instead of a VPN?**
   - Reverse SSH is simpler to set up, avoids the complexity and cost of VPNs, and doesn’t require static IP addresses on-prem.

4. **What are the advantages of Reverse SSH for accessing private subnets?**
   - It enables secure, outbound-only SSH connections without exposing the private subnet to public access. It’s easier to automate and doesn’t require complex networking.

5. **What are the security implications of using Reverse SSH?**
   - While it’s secure because it prevents direct inbound access, the SSH keys used in the tunnel must be carefully protected to prevent unauthorized access.

6. **What is the difference between SSH and Reverse SSH?**
   - SSH initiates a connection from the client to a server, while Reverse SSH establishes a tunnel from a remote server to a client, enabling access from the external system to the internal system.

7. **How would you automate Reverse SSH?**
   - Use `autossh` or `systemd` to automatically maintain the SSH tunnel even if the connection drops or the instance restarts.

8. **Can Reverse SSH be used for multiple systems?**
   - Yes, Reverse SSH can be used to establish tunnels for multiple systems by creating separate tunnels or ports for each instance.

9. **What is the role of the `-R` option in Reverse SSH?**
   - The `-R` option specifies remote port forwarding, mapping a port on the remote host (Bastion) to a local port (Controller) inside the private subnet.

10. **What ports must be open for Reverse SSH to work?**
    - Port 22 (SSH) should be open on the Bastion Host, the Controller, and the On-Prem Compute Node.

11. **How does Reverse SSH handle dynamic IP addresses?**
    - Reverse SSH doesn’t require a static IP on the on-prem node. The AWS Bastion Host forwards traffic even if the on-prem node’s IP changes.

12. **What is the difference between SSH Port Forwarding and Reverse SSH?**
    - SSH Port Forwarding forwards traffic from the local machine to a remote system. Reverse SSH forwards traffic from the remote system back to the local machine.

13. **What would happen if you didn’t open port 22 on the Bastion Host for inbound access?**
    - The Bastion Host wouldn’t be able to accept connections from the Controller or On-Prem node, and the Reverse SSH tunnel wouldn’t be established.

14. **What are the advantages of using a Bastion Host in a public subnet?**
    - It provides a controlled, secure access point to manage instances in private subnets without exposing them directly to the internet.

15. **What could be a potential failure point in a Reverse SSH setup?**
    - Network interruptions or improper SSH configurations (incorrect key files or permissions) could break the Reverse SSH tunnel.

16. **How can you monitor and troubleshoot Reverse SSH connections?**
    - Use logs on the Bastion Host and Controller, and tools like `autossh` for automatic reconnections. SSH verbose logging (`ssh -v`) can help troubleshoot issues.

17. **Can you use Reverse SSH to access resources in a different VPC?**
    - Yes, as long as the Bastion Host has appropriate routing to both VPCs and the required security group rules are configured.

18. **How would you secure SSH keys used for Reverse SSH?**
    - Use secure key management practices, like AWS Systems Manager or a dedicated secrets management service, and ensure that SSH keys are encrypted.

19. **Can Reverse SSH be used in an auto-scaling environment?**
    - Yes, using `autossh` or managing the tunnel via `systemd`, Reverse SSH can be maintained even as instances scale up and down.

20. **What would happen if the Bastion Host is down in a Reverse SSH setup?**
    - If the Bastion Host goes down, the Reverse SSH tunnel would break, and communication from the on-prem node to the Controller would be disrupted until the Bastion is restored.
