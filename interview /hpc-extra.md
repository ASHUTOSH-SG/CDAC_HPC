# **PXE BOOTING (Preboot Execution Environment)**

PXE (Preboot Execution Environment) is a method to boot computers over a network **without using local storage like hard drives or USBs**. It is commonly used in **HPC clusters** to deploy compute nodes efficiently.

### **How PXE Booting Works?**

1. **Power-On & Network Request:**
    - The compute node boots up and requests an **IP address** via **DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)**.
2. **PXE Server Response:**
    - The **PXE server** provides the **location of a boot image** (kernel + initrd).
3. **TFTP Transfer:**
    - The node downloads the required files using **TFTP (Trivial File Transfer Protocol)**.
4. **Booting into the OS Installer:**
    - The node boots into the **provided OS image** (e.g., a minimal Linux kernel for an HPC node).

### **Why PXE is used in HPC?**

✔ **Automates cluster deployment**

✔ **Centralized OS installation**

✔ **Diskless booting (Thin clients)**

✔ **Fast recovery & scaling**

fat tree in detail

### ChatGPT said:

### **Fat Tree Topology in HPC Networking**

Fat Tree is a **hierarchical network topology** commonly used in **High-Performance Computing (HPC)** clusters and **data centers** to provide high bandwidth and low latency for communication between compute nodes.

---

## **1. Why Fat Tree?**

The **traditional tree topology** has a bottleneck at higher levels, where many nodes must share limited bandwidth. Fat Tree solves this by providing **equal bandwidth at all levels**, ensuring **non-blocking communication**.

---

## **2. Fat Tree Structure**

Fat Tree is **multi-layered**, consisting of three levels:

1. **Leaf Layer (Compute Nodes)**
    - Directly connected to the first layer of switches.
    - These are the actual **compute nodes** of the cluster.
2. **Spine (Aggregation) Layer**
    - Intermediate switches aggregating multiple leaf-layer switches.
3. **Core Layer**
    - Top-level switches that connect aggregation switches.
    - Provides a **high-bandwidth, non-blocking backbone**.

👉 **Key Feature:**

Each level has **more links & bandwidth** than the previous one, ensuring that the upper levels do not become a bottleneck.

---

## **3. Bandwidth Balancing in Fat Tree**

Each switch has **equal bandwidth** going **upstream** (to higher layers) and **downstream** (to lower layers).

🔹 **Example:**

- A **1 Gbps** link per compute node.
- If a switch connects **4 compute nodes**, it will have **4 Gbps** uplink to the next layer.
- This ensures **non-blocking, full-bisection bandwidth** between any two nodes.

---

## **4. Routing Algorithms in Fat Tree**

Fat Tree networks use **ECMP (Equal-Cost Multi-Path)** routing or **custom HPC routing** like:

- **Valiant Load Balancing (VLB)** – Distributes traffic evenly.
- **Adaptive Routing** – Dynamically selects paths based on congestion.

---

## **5. Advantages of Fat Tree**

✅ **Non-blocking communication:** Ensures smooth data transfer between nodes.

✅ **Scalability:** Easily expands by adding more switches and links.

✅ **High bandwidth:** Every node gets equal access to network resources.

✅ **Fault tolerance:** Multiple paths reduce the risk of failure.

---

## **6. Fat Tree in HPC & Data Centers**

Fat Tree is used in:

- **HPC clusters** – Connecting thousands of compute nodes.
- **Data centers** – Used in large-scale cloud computing (AWS, Google Cloud).
- **InfiniBand networks** – HPC interconnects using Fat Tree for low-latency communication.

---

## **7. Comparison with Other Topologies**

| Topology | Bandwidth Efficiency | Scalability | Latency |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Fat Tree** | High (Non-blocking) | High | Low |
| Torus/Mesh | Medium | Medium | Medium |
| Dragonfly | Very High | High | Very Low |
| Clos | Very High | Very High | Very Low |

---

### **Conclusion**

Fat Tree is the **most popular** network topology in **HPC clusters and data centers** due to its **scalability, fault tolerance, and high bandwidth.** 🚀
